**Percentage Calculator** is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary purpose of this tool is to help users calculate the percentage of a value, find the base value given a percentage and a result, or determine the percentage value of a given number. 

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive User Interface:** The user-friendly interface is designed with a clean layout, including input fields for the percentage, value, and result. Users can quickly input any two values, and the calculator will automatically compute the third value.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** By inputting any two values (percentage, value, or result), the application dynamically calculates the missing value. This feature makes it versatile for various percentage-related calculations.
- **Responsive Design:** The application ensures compatibility across different devices, offering a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Clear & Simple Navigation:** Buttons for calculating results and clearing fields ensure ease of use. The displayed results are clearly formatted for quick understanding.
- **Error Handling:** The application prompts users to provide any two values if they have left fields blank, ensuring proper user guidance.

This project is a great example of using fundamental web technologies to create a practical tool for everyday use.
